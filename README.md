# Practical Deep Learning
Holding place for my messing around with Fastai's course work.

### To Use:
1. Clone and navigate into the repo
2. Make a virtual environment (requirements.txt downloads a LOT) with `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate said virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Ensure the deps were correctly installed:
    - Run `python3` and try `import fastai` and hit Return/Enter
    - If you get a `ModuleNotFound` error, your virtualenv may not be active or `pip3 install` may have failed, retry those steps if necessary.
6. Navigate to (Practical Deep Learning)[https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html] and get to AI'ing!
